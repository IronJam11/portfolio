    title: "Tree-Solidity (GSOC-2025)",
    description: "This project tackles the lack of transparency in tree-planting initiatives by developing a decentralized mobile application that leverages blockchain technology for verifiable and tamper-proof tracking. Each planted tree is minted as an NFT (ERC-721), storing critical metadata like geolocation, species, and planter details on-chain. To ensure authenticity, the system incorporates a community-driven verification mechanism where users can validate trees by submitting photo proofs stored on IPFS, earning tokenized rewards (ERC-20) for their participation.",
